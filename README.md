# Portable npm and related executables

## Synopsys

Essentially, this is just a set of [shell scripts](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/tree/master/bin) that manages a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) docker image. The docker image includes a script that allows commands to run as either the current user or the owner/group of the current directory, which the shell scripts take advantage of to make sure files are written with permissions that match the current directory.

### Installation

This assumes that you already have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed. A running `docker` daemon is required.

Installation is just a matter of putting the [shell scripts](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/tree/master/bin) somewhere in your path and making them executable. I like to put my scripts in a `bin/` folder in my home directory:
* `wget -nv -O ~/bin/npm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkenney/docker-npm/master/bin/npm && chmod 0755 ~/bin/npm`
* `wget -nv -O ~/bin/gulp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkenney/docker-npm/master/bin/gulp && chmod 0755 ~/bin/gulp`
* `wget -nv -O ~/bin/grunt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkenney/docker-npm/master/bin/grunt && chmod 0755 ~/bin/grunt`
* `npm self-update`
  All of the scripts have a `self-update` command which pulls down the latest docker image and then updates the shell script itself. If you don't have write permissions on the shell script you'll get a permissions error, you can run the self-update command with `sudo` if needed.

## About

This [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkenney/npm/) contains the latest `node` and `npm` binaries for [Debian:jessie](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/). `npm` has been used to install `gulp-cli` and `grunt-cli` globally. When using the [shell scripts](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/tree/master/bin) available in the [source repository](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm), the current directory is mounted into `/src` in the container and a wrapper script executes `npm` as a user who's `uid` and `gid` matches those properties on that directory. This way any output is written as the directory owner/group instead of root or a random user.

If you need additional modules and/or wrapper scripts (`bower`, etc.) [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues).

## Change log

### 2016-06-06

I modified the `run-as-user` script so that it doesn't require specifying which user account in container that should be modified, and instead will always modify the `dev` user. This required updating both the image and the wrapper scripts, if you use the wrapper scripts you should run:
* `sudo npm self-update`
* `sudo gulp self-update`
* `sudo grunt self-update`

### 2016-06-03

I removed the `as-user` script and put it in a [separate repo](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-scripts/blob/master/container/run-as-user) as it's used in several images. [Let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any trouble, this is the first image I've switched over.

### 2016-05-25

#### Breaking changes

I have added a wrapper script to the container that executes `npm`, `gulp` and `grunt` commands as a user who's `uid` and `gid` matches those properties on the current directory. This way any files are installed as the directory owner/group instead of root or a random user.

If you've been using the [previous version](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/tree/deprecated/bin) of the included shell scripts from the project's `/bin` directory you will probably need to update the permissions of files created using them or the new scripts are likely to have permissions errors because previously the files would have been created by the `root` user. This command should take care of it for you but _make sure you understand what it will do **before** you run it_. I can't help you if you hose your system.

* From your **_project directory_**: `sudo chown -R $(stat -c '%u' .):$(stat -c '%g' .) ./`

If you haven't been using the included scripts, then you don't need to do anything.

If you need to use the [previous version](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/tree/deprecated) of this image it's [tagged](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkenney/npm/tags/) as `deprecated` but the image is still rebuilt automatically when there are changes to [node:latest](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) or [Debian:jessie](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) so it will stay up to date.
